Basic layout update to Bookeo's Pop-up Desktop Widget

Bookeo has a good enough back-end to do what it's built to do for your business but the layout on desktop is cramped, cluttered, and dated. For customizing the CSS for the UI, the HTML markup and CSS selectors are un-semantic and poorly named, which makes improving it difficult. There's a lot more to the Bookeo UI I wish I could overwrite with CSS, but it results in styles being applied to unintended elements. So here's a 'safe' design update. Be sure to test with your actual application first since this hides some elements that you might need.

Paste CSS into Bookeo > SETTINGS > Colors and Styles > Custom CSS (advanced) box.
